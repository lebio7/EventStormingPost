# EventStormingPost
Simple project, where I try to use EventStorming + CQRS using MediatR

In this project, you can create post. 
After you created post, in project we have simple event with notification, which adds post to approve for Admin.

EventStormingPost.Infrastructure is very simple, without database, because my main target was created Post and used Publish to implement event.
